	<h2>Project Portfolio</h2>

	<!-- p means paragraph -->
	<p>Phillip Zhou is a 4th year Computer Science student as UCSD. <strike>He enjoys long walks on the beach, sipping wine from the 1300s, and commanding his peasants to procure him some food.</strike>
	He is currently taking a class on actual program design, as opposed to the program implementation. Phillip thinks that this is a new experience. Phillip thinks that such a class will be helpful in the future in becoming a well-rounded software engineer. Later on, Phillip wants to take more classes that are concerned with AI, computer graphics, and parallel processing.</p>

	<h2>Projects</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><h3>Tank Mode</h3> 
			<img src="Tank_Mode.png" alt="Gameplay Image" style="width:512px;height:256px;"> 
			<p> This game features a tick rate to ensure that the game's animations and control inputs are not dependent on the FPS. In addition, there are procedurally generated terrain and structures using Bezier surfaces and L-systems, respectively. There are also particle effects, toggleable sound effects, and a camera that tracks the movement of the tank. </p> </li>

		<li><h3>Pacman AI</h3>

			<p>This simulation of Pacman has an AI controlling it. Initially, the Pacman will make moves that aren't worth as much. However, as it continually fails, it will continue to learn more and more, eventually reaching the point where it can make smarter and smarter decisions based on the possible number of points.</p></li>
